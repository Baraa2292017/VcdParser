# Value Change Dump (VCD) File

A value change dump (VCD) file logs changes to variable values, such as the values of signals, in a file during a simulation session. VCD files can be useful during design verification. Some examples of how you might apply VCD files include the following cases:

- For comparing results of multiple simulation runs, using the same or different simulator environments
- As input to post-simulation analysis tools
- For porting areas of an existing design to a new design

VCD files can provide data that you might not otherwise acquire unless you understood the details of a device's internal logic. In addition, they include data that can be graphically displayed or analyzed with postprocessing tools, including, for example, the extraction of data about a particular section of a design hierarchy or data generated during a specific time interval.

This parser show useful data from the simulation like all modules, signals, signals switching activity, clock frequency, simulation date and simulation tool version.
